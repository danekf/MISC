# Plex request
This repo is setup to use mongoDB to allow users to request that content be added to a plex library. This serves as the backend for the plex request project.
<br>
Data is saved to a mongoose db (using db atlas data api) and will catalog everything so that users can see available content at a glance from any device and immediately request missing content without needing any 3rd party apps.
