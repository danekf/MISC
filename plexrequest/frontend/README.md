# Plex request
This repo is setup to use mongoDB to allow users to request that content be added to a plex library. This serves as the backend for the plex request project.
<br>
Data is saved to a mongoose db (using db atlas data api) and will catalog everything so that users can see available content at a glance from any device and immediately request missing content without needing any 3rd party apps.
<br>
The plan is to build a functional site. And then use the skeleton as a base from which to build a React Native app for daily use of the built backend.

## Dependencies
<ul> 
  <li>mongoose @ 7.2.2</li>
  <li>dotenv @ 16.1.4</li>

</ul>
